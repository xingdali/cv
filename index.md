## Education

### **University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill** `2019.8 -`

```
Chapel Hill, NC
```

- B.S. Computer Science, GPA: 3.61/4.0

### **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign** `2018.8 - 2019.5`

```
Urbana, IL
```


## Experience

### **Orka, Foster City, CA** `2021.3 - 2021.7`

_Software Engineer Intern_<br>
- Worked with the software development team (mentored by [Chauncey Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chauncey-lu-657b9580/) and [Yufan Yuan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yufan-yuan-1b8117135/)) on building the official [website](https://hiorka.com). I developed the user interface using ReactJS, and backend api using Django for the refund process. I also participated in developing a hearing aid fitting console, which provides user interface for audiologists to check patient medical information, and modify parameters on patients' hearing aids during remote and in-person fitting. For the remote fitting function, my teammate and I used Websocket to send messages to patient's phone and manipulate hearing aids by BLE. We also accomplished real-time video chat between audiologist's browser and patient's phone to solve remote communication issues using Twilio.
- Applied Jenkins and Docker for CI/CD infrastructure. I wrote shell scripts for building, deploying applications, and sending email notifications of the building information. I also implemented and migrated static files on server to the AWS S3 in order to store future files uploaded by users.
- **Fall Detection** is an application that detecting user's fall down movement, which running on the hearing aid. I first trained a 1D CNN model based on signals from 3-axis Accelerometer on human waists using Tensorflow Deep Learning Library. Since the hearing aid is an embedded system, I built a simple 1D CNN library in C, which can load and deploy any 1D CNN models trained in Tensorflow on the hearing aid. I also optimized the CNN algorithm specifically for the ARM architecture chip on the hearing aid using CMSIS DSP Library for superior performance.
- Built an mobile application for collecting Fall Detection training dataset from hearing aids on human ears using Flutter. I used a Bluetooth API to get signals from 3-axis Accelerometer on hearing aid, and formatted data into CSV files. During data collection, a video recording feature is also applied for future data annotation.

### **CourseEval, Chapel Hill, NC** `2020.8 - 2020.11`

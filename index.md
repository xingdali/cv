```
Chapel Hill, NC
```

_Software Developer_<br>
- Working with [UNC Reese Innovation Lab](https://reeseinnovate.com) to develop a website for uploading and managing captures to generate 3D models.
- Designed PostgreSQL database schema for data storage and Django model development.
- Developed client side responsive web layout using React and MaterialUI for features including uploading and downloading files, and monitoring 3D model generating process.
- Hosted the web application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, managed Docker images using Elastic Container Registry, and storaging static and 3D model files using S3.

Trained 1D CNN models based on signals from 3-axis Accelerometer using Tensorflow Deep Learning Library. Built a simple 1D CNN library in C for loading and deploying any 1D CNN models onto the hearing aid. Optimized the algorithm specifically for the ARM architecture chip on the hearing aid using CMSIS DSP Library for superior performance.
- Built a mobile application for collecting Fall Detection training dataset from sensors embedded in hearing aids using Flutter. Implemented methods for collecting data through BLE, and formatting them. A video recording feature is also applied to make future data annotation easier.
